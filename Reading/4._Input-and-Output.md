# Input and Output

When writing scripts it is important to have them customizable, with user input. The command in PowerShell to get input is ```Read-Host```.

## Input

The ```Read-Host``` cmdlet reads a line of input from the console.

```PowerShell
$Name = Read-Host "Please enter you name"
$Name
```

You can save the input as a secure string, so you can use this cmdlet to prompt users for secure data. You do this by using the ```-AsSecureString``` parameter

```PowerShell
$Password = Read-Host "Enter your password" -AsSecureString
```

There is also the ```-Prompt``` parameter which if the input string includes spaces, it will be enclosed in quotation marks. PowerShell also appends a colon to the text you enter.

## Output

In PowerShell you use ```Write-Host`` to customize the output where it is a variable, static statement or piped objects.

```PowerShell
Write-Host "Hello World
```

You are also able to write to the console without add a new line by using the ```-NoNewline``` parameter.

```PowerShell
Write-Host "First String" -NoNewline
Write-Host "Second String
```

If you have multiple output then you can use a separator between them by using ```-Separator```.

```PowerShell
Write-Host (1,2,3,4,5) -Separator " +1= "
```

You are able to set the text and background color for the output.

```PowerShell
Write-Host "Green on Red TEST" -ForegroundColor Green -BackgroundColor Red
```

The valid colors are:

- Black
- DarkBlue
- DarkGreen
- DarkCyan
- DarkRed
- DarkMagenta
- DarkYellow
- Gray
- DarkGray
- Blue
- Green
- Cyan
- Red
- Magenta
- Yellow
- White

You are able to supress the output from ```Write-Host``` and there are two ways of doing it.

```PowerShell
Write-Host "Can't See Me" -InformationAction Ignore
Write-Host "Can't See Me" 6>$null
```
