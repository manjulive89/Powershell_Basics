# Background

This is just a quick background about what items are called in powershell.

## Cmdlet

A cmdlet is a "command let" which is a lightweight command in powershell. They are the basic command that you will use.

## Variables

All variables start with ```$``` and are set with

```PowerShell
$variable1 = "generic text"
```

There are some [Automatic Variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_automatic_variables?view=powershell-6) which are created by powershell. You can write to them, however they should be treated as read-only.  

Some of the automatic variables are:

- ```$_```
  - This contains the current object in the pipeline object. This is variable that you use when passing them.
- ```$HOME```
  - Contain the full path of the current user's home directory.

## Parameters

Cmdlets have parameters that you can use with them. They all start with ```-```.

Examples:

- ```-Path```
- ```-File```
- ```-WhatIf```

## Properties

Each object has different properties that you can use to filer them by. Files and Folder have properties such as size, last modified date, and the last user to access them. Processes have properties such as PID, status and path. Properties will come after the object with a ```.```.

```PowerShell
$file = Get-ChildItem file.txt
$file.length
```

To get the full list of properties for an object pipe a cmdlet to ```Get-Member```.

```PowerShell
Get-Service | Get-Member
```
