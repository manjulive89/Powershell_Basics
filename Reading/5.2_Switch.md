# Switch

To check a condition in a script or function, use an ```If``` statement. To check multiple conditions, use a ```Switch``` statement.

The basic syntax format for switch:

```PowerShell
Switch (<test-value>)
{
    <condition> {<action>}
    <condition> {<action>}
}
```

an example:

```PowerShell
switch (3)
{
    1 {"It is one."}
    2 {"It is two."}
    3 {"It is three."}
    4 {"It is four."}
}

It is three.
```

You can have multiple action statements for a switch.

```PowerShell
switch (3)
{
    1 {"It is one."}
    2 {"It is two."}
    3 {"It is three."}
    4 {"It is four."}
    3 {"Three again."}
}

It is three.
Three again.
```

If you want switch to stop comparing after a match then use ```Break```.

```PowerShell
switch (3)
{
    1 {"It is one."}
    2 {"It is two."}
    3 {"It is three."; Break}
    4 {"It is four."}
    3 {"Three again."}
}

It is three.
```

## Default

If there is no matching case then there will be no output. If you to preform an action when no other condition is met then add a ```Default``` cause.

```PowerShell
switch (6)
{
    1 {"It is one."; Break}
    2 {"It is two."; Break}
    3 {"It is three."; Break}
    4 {"It is four."; Break}
    Default {
        "No matches"
    }
}

No matches
```

If you want words to to match a case then you need to use either the ```-Wildcard``` or ```-Regex``` parameter.

## Wildcard

If you want to use wildcards(*) with switch then you have to have the ```-Wildcard``` parameter.

```PowerShell
switch -Wildcard ("fourteen")
{
    1 {"It is one."; Break}
    2 {"It is two."; Break}
    3 {"It is three."; Break}
    4 {"It is four."; Break}
    "fo*" {"That's too many."}
}

That's too many.

```

## Regex

You can also use regex with the ```-Regex``` parameter.

```PowerShell
$target = 'user@contoso.com'
switch -Regex ($target)
{
    'ftp\://.*' { "$_ is an ftp address"; Break }
    '\w+@\w+\.com|edu|org' { "$_ is an email address"; Break }
    'http[s]?\://.*' { "$_ is a web address"; Break }
}

user@contoso.com is an email address
```

## File

You can take input from a file rather than a value state. Each line of the file is read and evaluated.
