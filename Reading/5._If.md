# If Statements

The basic syntax format for if statements:

```PowerShell
if (<test1>)
    {<statement list 1>}
[elseif (<test2>)
    {<statement list 2>}]
[else
    {<statement list 3>}]
```

Each tests requires a [comparison operator](5.1._Comparison-Operators.md).

You are able to add as many elseif statements to further narrow down your search.  

You can also use [switch](5.2_Switch.md) to handle multiple If statements.
