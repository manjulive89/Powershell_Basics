# Getting File Information

# Story Line: Basic Folder and File information Gathering


# Please write and run the command that you would need to get all the files in your home directory (Typically at C:\Users\<USERNAME>)



# Modify the command so that it would get all hidden files and recurse through all sub-folders. (You do not have to run it because it can take some time if you have a lot of files.)



# Modify the command so that it prints the name and last write time for each file in the your home directory. Set a variable equal to the command. Hint: foreach and Get-Member
